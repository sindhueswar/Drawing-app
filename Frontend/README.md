# Real-time Collaborative drawing App

A real-time collaborative drawing application built with React.js and Socket.io.

## Features

- Real-time drawing synchronization
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend folder:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sindhueswar/realtime-drawing-app.git
    cd realtime-drawing-app/backend
    ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:
    ```bash
    cd realtime-drawing-app
    ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Ensure the backend server is running (`node server.js`).
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

You should now be able to draw on the canvas and see real-time updates across multiple browser windows or tabs.
